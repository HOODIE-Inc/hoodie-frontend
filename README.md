# Hoodie

This is Hoodie App's UI. 

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HOODIE-Inc/hoodie-frontend
cd hoodie-frontend
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

* `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".

These are the test-related scripts:

* `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
